# julea-betree

To expose the `betree_storage_stack` usable to JULEA, we need to encapsulate the
functionality by implementing the `Backend` type. For documentation of specifics
refer to the [JULEA
documentation](https://github.com/parcio/julea/blob/master/doc/implementing-backend.md).

You will most likely not need to modify this code when implementing features in *Haura*.
