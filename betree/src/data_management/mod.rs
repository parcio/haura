//! This module provides the Data Management Layer
//! which handles user-defined objects and includes caching and write back.
//!
//! The main point of interest is the [Dmu] which provides most of the functions
//! you are probably interested in. The [Dmu] implements the [Dml] trait, which
//! is a convenience trait to hide away most generics form other modules by
//! using associated types.
//!
//! # Name collisions
//!
//! Take care that in the context of the [Dml] we refer to nodes in a tree as
//! `Object` in things like [ObjectPointer] and [ObjectReference]. These are not large
//! data blobs as in the [crate::object] module.
